## Features Covered in This Guide
Setting Up IntelliJ IDEA Features guides users through configuring Git version control, the CheckStyle plugin, and unit tests using JUnit. They are three helpful features for working with IntelliJ IDEA.

### Git Version Control
This guide presents the steps in starting a new project in IntelliJ IDEA and creating a Git repository for that project. Additionally, there are instructions for sharing the project on GitHub and tracking project changes.

### CheckStyle Plugin
This guide covers how to install the CheckStyle plugin and how to run tests to ensure that code adheres to stylistic coding conventions.

### Unit Tests Using JUnit
This guide also goes through the steps to install JUnit, a unit testing framework. Furthermore, there will be an example of how to examine unit tests to verify the functionality of parts of code.

## Methods and Processes Used to Prepare This Guide
Markdown, Git, GitHub, and technical writing practices for instructions were used to prepare this guide. 

### Markdown
This guide uses [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) as its site theme. We forked the Just the Docs GitHub repository and edited and updated the pages with our own documentation content. Each documentation page in this guide is primarily written in markdown and HTML. Examples from the Just the Docs GitHub repository were helpful in preparing this guide's documentation in markdown. We also referred to the [GitHub Mastering Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to assist us with the markdown process.

Markdown was used throughout the documentation for elements like headers, lists, tables, adding images and alternative captions, and text style (e.g. emphasis of text).

### Git and GitHub
Git and GitHub were used for version control. As we worked in a team of two to complete this guide, using a version control system helped better facilitate project collaboration. 

This guide is hosted through GitHub Pages.

### Technical writing practices for instructions
*Writing in the Technical Fields: A Practical Guide* by Thorsten Ewald has information on how to write instructions and procedures. We learned and applied topics from the book such as typographical conventions, content structure of instruction sets, and tips on graphics in our guide.

## Conclusion
Through the process of creating this guide, we were able to gain experience in communicating and collaborating in a team to produce user documentation. Additionally, we gained experience in technical writing, using markdown, and using Git and GitHub to manage our work.

We hope that potential users of this guide are able to gain an understanding and make use of some of the helpful features in IntelliJ IDEA as they start developing their projects.
